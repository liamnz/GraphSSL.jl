## Installation

## Getting Started

## How does it all work?

TODO
* transduction vs induction - not a model per se, more like an imputation algorithm
* intro to the iterative label propagation algorithm, GraphSSL is an analytic solution to that
* Graph and graph construction
* Description of the linear system being solved (but not the scary proofs in the paper, I do not understand that...)
